# Object Classification System for Birds and Drones 

## Overview
This project aims to develop an object classification system that distinguishes between birds and drones using radar technology. The system is implemented with Flask, a Python microframework, for seamless integration between the machine learning model and the frontend interface.

## Technologies Used
- Radar technology
- Machine learning (CNNs, SVMs, Random Forests)
- Flask framework



## Usage
1. Upload radar data through the frontend interface.
2. Receive real-time classification results distinguishing between birds and drones.
